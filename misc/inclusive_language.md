## Inclusive Language Commitment

Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem. Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This material may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community. Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this resource. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com
