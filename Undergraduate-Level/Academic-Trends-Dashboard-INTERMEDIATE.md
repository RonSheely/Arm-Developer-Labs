### Project Difficulty
Intermediate

## Description
This project aims to design a dashboard that tracks the progression of academic papers on computer science over time. The main deliverable is a web scraping tool that pulls keywords from academic papers, considering the popularity of the paper and its publication. The data will be displayed in a web browser format, allowing users to visualize trends and changes in research focus over time. This project will provide practical experience in using APIs, web scraping, and data analysis. The final output will be a functional dashboard that presents the data in an intuitive and interactive manner.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 6 weeks to complete, involving a small team of 2-3 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, JavaScript or any programming language
- Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Flask/Django for the dashboard, APIs for accessing academic papers
- Hardware: Access to a computer with internet connectivity

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on web scraping, data analysis, and API usage
- Textbooks: "Web Scraping with Python" by Ryan Mitchell, "Data Science from Scratch" by Joel Grus
- Similar projects: Previous academic paper tracking projects available on GitHub
- Previous project submissions: GitHub link to past projects

## Benefits / Prizes
Participants will gain practical experience in web scraping, data analysis, and using APIs. Outstanding projects may receive kudos and recognition on academic platforms.
