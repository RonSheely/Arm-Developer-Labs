# AMBA Infrastructure Design and Simulation Framework (AS)
![supporting image]()

### Project Difficulty
Intermediate

## Description
This project aims to develop a reference design of AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) infrastructure. The main deliverables include the Verilog design of the AMBA infrastructure, a Verilog test bench for testing the design, an RTL (Register Transfer Level) simulation flow to verify the functionality, and an FPGA prototyping platform to demonstrate the design in a real-world environment. The project will provide a comprehensive understanding of AMBA protocols and their implementation, making it an excellent learning opportunity for students interested in digital design and hardware description languages.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 10 to 12 weeks to complete, involving a team of 3-4 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: ModelSim, Quartus, Vivado
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera), simulation tools
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
