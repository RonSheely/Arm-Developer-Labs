# Smart Voice Assistant Using ML on Cortex-M55 (RI)
![supporting image]()

### Project Difficulty
Accessible

## Description
This undergraduate project aims to develop a simple voice assistant that can recognize spoken commands such as “turn on the light,” “play music,” and other similar tasks. The voice assistant will be able to control peripheral devices accordingly. The main objective is to showcase the power of a low-cost Cortex-M55/U55 to create low-level machine learning applications. The deliverables include a functional voice assistant capable of understanding and executing basic commands, along with documentation detailing the development process and the performance of the system.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 6 to 8 weeks to complete, making it perfect for a semester-long project. It can be undertaken by a small team of 2-3 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, C++
- Tooling: TensorFlow Lite, Keil MDK
- Hardware: Cortex-M55/U55 development board, microphone, peripheral devices (e.g., lights, speakers)
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on machine learning and embedded systems
- Textbooks: "Machine Learning for Embedded Systems" by Matthew Kirk
