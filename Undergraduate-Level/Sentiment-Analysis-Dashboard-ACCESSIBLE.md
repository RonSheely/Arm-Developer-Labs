### Project Difficulty
Intermediate

## Description
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis dashboard for keywords related to the semiconductor industry. The main deliverable is a web scraping script that gathers text data from various semiconductor news sites. This data will then be processed through a sentiment analysis LLM (Large Language Model) to determine the sentiment of the content. The project will provide practical experience in web scraping, data processing, and using LLMs for sentiment analysis. The final output will be a functional dashboard that displays the sentiment analysis results in an easy-to-understand format.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 3 weeks to complete, involving a small team of 2-3 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python
- Tooling: BeautifulSoup, Selenium, TensorFlow, Flask/Django for the dashboard
