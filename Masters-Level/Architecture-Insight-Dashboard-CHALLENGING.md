![supporting image]()

### Project Difficulty
Intermediate
**Audience:** Computer Science (CS) / Electrical Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard that lets a developer know what proportion of devices support a specific Arm CPU extension, similar to “Can I use” for web development. The project involves tracking support across various platforms, analyzing popularity trends, and identifying key OEMs. Students will gain hands-on experience with data visualization, web development, and market analysis, providing valuable insights into the Arm ecosystem. The main deliverable is a functional dashboard that presents the data in an intuitive and interactive manner.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 8-12 weeks to complete, involving a team of 3-4 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, JavaScript
- Tooling: D3.js, Flask/Django for the dashboard, APIs for data collection
- Hardware: Access to a computer with internet connectivity
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on data visualization, web development, and market analysis
- Textbooks: "Data Visualization with D3.js" by Scott Murray, "Flask Web Development" by Miguel Grinberg
