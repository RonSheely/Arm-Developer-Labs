# KSA Curriculum Mapper [RI]
![supporting image]()

### Project Difficulty
Challenging
**Audience:** Computer Science (CS) / Electrical Engineering (EE)

## Description
This project aims to create a mobile-based chatbot/app that utilizes the KSA framework to map against openly published university or online course curricula. The goal is to generate a 'hot list' of courses that align most closely with the KSA. This project will leverage the existing software stack supporting LLMs on mobile devices, but will also challenge the developer to create the infrastructure to handle backend processes such as databases, natural language processing, and managing power and memory constraints on mobile devices. The main deliverable is a functional chatbot/app that provides valuable insights into course alignment with the KSA framework.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 12 months to complete, involving a team of 4-5 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: Python, JavaScript
- Tooling: TensorFlow, Flask/Django for the backend, mobile development frameworks (e.g., React Native)
- Hardware: Access to mobile devices for testing, computer with internet connectivity
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on natural language processing, mobile app development, and database management
- Textbooks: "Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, "Mobile App Development with React Native" by Ethan Holmes and Tom Bray
