## Project Difficulty

Challenging

## Target Audience

Computer Science, Computer Engineering or AI students

## Description

This project challenges students to build an intelligent automation tool for porting software packages â€” particularly in ecosystems like Bioconda â€” to native Arm-based platforms such as Apple Silicon (osx-arm64) and Linux on Arm.

Although most top Bioconda packages now support Linux/Arm, there's still a significant gap for native macOS on Apple Silicon, where many packages default to emulated x86 environments. The goal is to build a sophisticated system (beyond simple shell scripts) that uses dependency graph analysis, machine learning, to:

- Identify unported packages
- Trace recursive dependency issues
- Recommend or auto-generate build recipes
- Generate pull requests for Bioconda/Conda-Forge
- Evaluate build success and reattempt intelligently
- Be extensible to work with other Python packaging systems

ðŸ”¬ Students will gain practical experience with CI/CD systems, Python packaging with bioconda, 

This project is an ideal blend of automation, machine learning, and systems programming â€” built with real-world impact in mind. The outcome could directly contribute to open source ecosystems and help bring cutting-edge bioinformatics tools to wider hardware audiences.

## Hardware / Software Requirements

Hardware: Access to Apple Silicon either through the cloud or with Physical hardware
Languages: Python, Bash, Nextflow
Tooling: nf-core pipelines, Conda, BioConda, Docker/Singularity, Snakemake
