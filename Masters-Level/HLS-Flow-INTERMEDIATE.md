### Project Difficulty
Intermediate

## Description
This project aims to develop a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow for integrating hardware accelerators with Arm-based System on Chip (SoC). The main objective is to lower the barrier for computer science students to create hardware accelerators from software algorithms. The deliverables include a comprehensive HLS design flow, documentation detailing the steps involved, and a functional hardware accelerator integrated with an Arm-based SoC. This project will provide practical experience in HLS, SoC design, and hardware acceleration, making it an excellent learning opportunity for students interested in digital design and embedded systems.

## Estimated Project Duration
The project is estimated to take 8-10 weeks to complete, involving a team of 3-4 participants. There is no hard deadline, but timely completion is encouraged to maximize learning outcomes.

## Hardware / Software Requirements
- Languages: C++, SystemVerilog
- Tooling: Vivado HLS, ModelSim
- Hardware: FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx or Altera)
- IP access: Arm Academic Access member (link to get if they don't have it)

## Resources
- Learning paths: Online courses on HLS, SoC design, and hardware acceleration
