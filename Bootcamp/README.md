## Bootcamps

For learners, bootcamps are sandboxed end-to-end projects with example solutions and teaching resources that will enable you to learn the skills required to take on some of our academic projects.  

For teachers, bootcamp projects are designed to be completed in no more than 4 hours and are complemented with teaching resources to help teachers supervise projects.
